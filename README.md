## ðŸ”° **1. Foundation: Why Generics?**

### Goals:

* Understand **type safety**, **reusability**, and **elimination of casting**.
* Know the problems with using `Object` and raw types (pre-Java 5).

### Study Topics:

* What is type erasure?
* Before/after Java 5 code examples (`List<Object>` vs `List<String>`).
* Runtime vs compile-time safety.

---

## ðŸ§± **2. Basic Syntax and Use Cases**

### Goals:

* Learn the core syntax and how to declare/use generics.

### Study Topics:

* Generic types:

  ```java
  class Box<T> { T value; }
  ```
* Using generic classes:

  ```java
  Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
  ```
* Generic methods:

  ```java
  public <T> void print(T input) { ... }
  ```
* Built-in generic interfaces: `List<T>`, `Map<K,V>`, `Comparator<T>`

---

## ðŸ”„ **3. Bounded Type Parameters**

### Goals:

* Control which types are allowed with generics.

### Study Topics:

* **Upper bounds**:

  ```java
  <T extends Number>
  ```
* **Lower bounds** (used in wildcards):

  ```java
  <? super Integer>
  ```
* `T extends Comparable<T>` pattern.

---

## ðŸª¢ **4. Wildcards: The Real Challenge**

### Goals:

* Master PECS (Producer Extends, Consumer Super) rule.

### Study Topics:

* Unbounded wildcard: `<?>`
* Upper-bounded: `<? extends Number>` (for reading)
* Lower-bounded: `<? super Integer>` (for writing)
* Covariance and contravariance.
* Why `List<Object>` is **not** a supertype of `List<String>`.

---

## ðŸ§° **5. Generic Methods and Constructors**

### Goals:

* Know how to parameterize methods, not just classes.

### Study Topics:

* Define static and instance methods with `<T>`:

  ```java
  public static <T> T identity(T input) { return input; }
  ```
* Generic constructors in generic or non-generic classes.

---

## ðŸ§  **6. Type Inference and Diamond Operator**

### Goals:

* Simplify and clarify code using type inference.

### Study Topics:

* Diamond operator (`<>`) with constructors:

  ```java
  List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
  ```
* Type inference in method calls (Java 8+ improvements).

---

## ðŸ§¬ **7. Generic Interfaces and Inheritance**

### Goals:

* Understand inheritance and overriding rules with generics.

### Study Topics:

* Creating generic interfaces:

  ```java
  interface Repository<T> { T findById(int id); }
  ```
* Implementing generic interfaces in generic and non-generic classes.
* Type parameter shadowing and overriding rules.

---

## ðŸ§© **8. Advanced Topics**

### Goals:

* Tackle deeper issues and patterns in generics.

### Study Topics:

* Type erasure in depth: how generic types are compiled.
* Bridge methods in generics.
* Intersection types:

  ```java
  <T extends InterfaceA & InterfaceB>
  ```
* Recursive bounds:

  ```java
  <T extends Comparable<T>>
  ```
* Multiple type parameters:

  ```java
  class Pair<K, V> { ... }
  ```

---

## ðŸ§ª **9. Practical Patterns and Pitfalls**

### Goals:

* Learn real-world patterns and avoid common mistakes.

### Study Topics:

* Generic builders.
* Generic utilities like `Collections.copy()`.
* Wildcard capture and helper methods:

  ```java
  public <T> void swap(List<T> list, int i, int j)
  ```
* Raw types vs parameterized types.
* Generic array creation issues (and how to handle it):

  ```java
  @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
  T[] array = (T[]) new Object[size];
  ```

---

## ðŸ§µ **10. Real-World Applications**

### Goals:

* Apply generics in software architecture.

### Study Topics:

* Custom generic repositories in Spring Data.
* Use in API responses (`ResponseEntity<T>`).
* Integration with MapStruct, Jackson, Retrofit (serialization issues with generics).
* TypeToken pattern in Gson for deserialization.
* Dependency injection with generics (e.g., `Qualifier` and generics in Spring).

## ðŸ§­ Learning Tips

* âœ… Read the official [Java Generics tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/index.html).
* âœ… Explore **Effective Java (3rd Edition)** by Joshua Bloch â€” especially the generics chapter.
* âœ… Practice with LeetCode & real-world tasks (e.g., writing reusable services or repositories).
* âœ… Use `javap -c` or bytecode decompilers to study type erasure in practice.
